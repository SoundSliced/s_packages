This folder contains example images used by the README. The current images are programmatically generated examples to illustrate how the corner ribbon looks in each corner of a sample widget.

Replace these images with actual screenshots or an animated GIF if you want a more realistic visual.

To create screenshots:
1. Run the `example` app on a simulator or device.
2. Use the device screenshot facility or `flutter screenshot` to capture images.
3. Place screenshots into this folder and update README.md paths accordingly.
